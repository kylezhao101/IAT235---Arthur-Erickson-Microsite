                        Housing artifacts of the Pacific Northwest cultures and First nations of British 
                        Columbia, the Museum of Anthropology was designed around the site’s context. Erickson
                        reflects the structure of the traditional architecture of the first nations through 
                        the use of towering concrete piers and beams in the façade of the building. 
                        <br><br>
                        The museum is designed such that a visitor’s procession reflects a journey starting from the forest,
                        then entering a clearing which reveals the prospect of land and water. This form of biomimicry
                        creates influences the buildings aesthetics and circulation of museum visitors.

                    <h2>curating a journey</h2>
                    <p1>
                        Designing with environment in mind, Erickson creates a journey for museum
                        visitors that reflect the natural site. As the building is both within forest 
                        cover and a clearing, the journey through this museum mimics the experience of traversing
                        a forest then exiting into a clearing.                       
                        The beginning of the journey mimics forest cover, with large concrete
                        beams with spaces for skylight in addition to a downwards slope that
                        matches the site the museum is built above. The spaced
                        sections of the hallways walls that gradually increase the horizontal
                        space of the area, the downward slope and periodically lowering of the
                        roof collaborate to attract the visitor towards the main hall. With the
                        narrower circulation, dimmer lighting, and lower ceiling, the main hall’s
                        grand scale is emphasized. It is only through this limitation of visual
                        senses and range of view that leads to a
                        powerful sense of freedom and awe in the main hall.

                    <p1>
                        The wide window walls emphasize the size and height of the rhythmically 
                        spaced concrete piers and totems as the sunlight fully covers them, casting large 
                        shadows onto visitors which solidifies the sense of height. With the non-ornamentation, 
                        smooth texture, and basic shaping style of the surroundings, the viewers eyes are guided 
                        to the intricate details of artifacts throughout the museum. <br><br>
                        With the large glass panels, the barrier between viewer and natural environment is broken,
                        the beauty of the surrounding nature is connnected with the artifacts inside the building, creating 
                        an unique and engaging experience for museum visitors.

                    This 3-block development involved the Vancouver provincial law courts,
                    Robson Square, and the Vancouver Art Gallery. The three-block development
                    is connected by a three dimensional urban park which incorporates a block-long
                    rooftop reflecting pool, three waterfalls, a foot bridge, and a planted mountain like landscape.

                        With the large, angled glass ceiling that maximizes viewing angles for 
                        the tiered court rooms, Erickson aims to alleviate tension or stress that
                        court attendees may experience by allowing the visitors to view and feel
                        connected with the surrounding cityscape and sky. With the lack of supporting
                        walls and supports placed on the tiered concrete piers and beams, an open plan
                        is created. In contrast to traditional court buildings that feel cramped an restrict
                        the circulation of people, the Vancouver courthouse the large glass roof and open 
                        plan to create a more positive and free experience, alleviating the barrier between interior and exterior environment.

                    <p1>
                        When designing the Three Block Complex and Robson Square, Arthur Erickson envisioned
                        for the project to incorporate a low-profile structure and open in space for the many
                        buildings that surround the complex. In contrast, a block-long rooftop and a mountain-like
                        structure leads to the provincial court, creating a unique urban landscape. With the lacking
                        of ornamentation in the concrete structures, the elements of water, and fauna act as ornamentation
                        and appear more vibrant and lively.  Erickson creates a park-like, relaxing atmosphere relative to
                        the surround sidewalks and main roads that restrict the flow of people.
